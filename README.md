**PROJECT TITLE:** ASSIGNMENT#5
**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:** Introduction to GitHub
**GETTING STARTED:**
In order to run the Python codes, we must have Jupyter Notebook installed in the system. 
Also, we require dataset in the .xls or .csv format.
**RUNNING THE PYTHON CODES:**
The pyhton file is a sample file to understand the GitHub platform by creating the new repository.
The attached Python file named 'Test Codes- Hemantkumar Patel' is based on Hitters Dataset. 
The objective of the Python file is to understand the dataset by using functions like head(), describe(), and median().
**PYTHON FILE DETAILS:**
In the Python file, we are importing libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.pyplot in the first step.
Then we loaded the dataset with the help of pd.read_excel function.
To view the dataset we ran the head() function which returned top 5 rows of the Hitters Dataset.
Then we applied .describe() function which returned important outputs like mean, standard deviations, count, min, max, and quartile values.
Later in the Python codes, meadin() function is used to find out median values of Hits, Homerun, PutOuts, and Assists.
